# Reverse Shell Code using Python

## Introduction 
I've created this Basic Reverse Shell in Python to provide an understanding and a fundamental tool for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and students in the cyber security field. Remember, this tool is for educational purposes only.

## Description:
A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine initiates a connection back to the attacker's machine. This allows the attacker to gain remote access and control over the target machine. Reverse shells are commonly used in penetration testing and ethical hacking to demonstrate vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.

## Purpose of the Program
The purpose of this program is to provide a basic and educational example of how a reverse shell can be implemented in Python. It is essential to note that this code is meant for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities. Understanding how reverse shells work is crucial for defending against potential cyber threats.
